# Mastering Prometheus Monitoring – A DevOps Engineer's Complete Toolkit

**Name:** Robert Mola (robert.mola@student.moringaschool.com)

## 1. Title & Objective

**Technology**: Prometheus (Monitoring & Alerting System)  
**Why I chose it**: As a junior DevOps engineer with experience in Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, and cloud platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP), monitoring is the critical missing piece for production reliability. Prometheus is the industry standard for metrics collection and alerting in modern DevOps stacks.

**End Goal**: Build a complete production-ready monitoring stack using Docker Compose that demonstrates:
- System metrics monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
- Container metrics monitoring (Docker containers)
- Custom application metrics (Python Flask app)
- Data visualization with Grafana
- Alert rule configuration and management

## 2. Quick Summary of the Technology

**What is it?**  
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It uses a pull-based model to scrape metrics from targets and stores them as time-series data with powerful querying capabilities via PromQL.

**Where is it used?**
- Production system monitoring and SRE practices
- Container orchestration monitoring (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Microservices observability and APM
- Infrastructure alerting and SLA monitoring
- DevOps CI/CD pipeline monitoring

**Real-world example**: Netflix uses Prometheus across their global infrastructure to monitor millions of metrics, ensuring 99.99% uptime for their streaming platform serving 200+ million subscribers worldwide.

## 3. System Requirements

**Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows (WSL2 recommended)  
**Required Tools**:
- Docker (version 20.10+)
- Docker Compose (version 1.29+)
- Terminal/Command line access
- Web browser
- Text editor (VS Code recommended)

**System Resources**:
- Minimum: 4GB RAM, 2GB free disk space
- Recommended: 8GB RAM, 5GB free disk space
- Internet connection for Docker image downloads

## 4. Installation & Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites
```bash
# Check Docker installation
docker --version
docker-compose --version

# Expected output:
# Docker version 24.0.5, build ced0996
# docker-compose version 1.29.2, build 5becea4c
```

### Step 2: Create Project Structure
```bash
# Create main project directory
mkdir prometheus-devops-lab
cd prometheus-devops-lab

# Create complete directory structure
mkdir -p prometheus/config
mkdir -p prometheus/data
mkdir -p grafana/data
mkdir -p grafana/provisioning/datasources
mkdir -p grafana/provisioning/dashboards
mkdir -p sample-app

# Set proper permissions for Docker containers
chmod 777 prometheus/data grafana/data
```

### Step 3: Complete File Structure
Your project should look like this:
```
prometheus-devops-lab/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── prometheus/
│   ├── config/
│   │   ├── prometheus.yml
│   │   └── alert_rules.yml
│   └── data/                    # Prometheus data storage

  curl -s http://localhost:5000/simulate-error > /dev/null
  sleep 1
done
```

#### Test Prometheus Queries
In Prometheus UI (http://localhost:9090/graph), try these queries:

**System Metrics**:
```promql
# CPU Usage
100 - (avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100)

# Memory Usage
(1 - (node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes)) * 100

# Disk Usage
(1 - (node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/"} / node_filesystem_size_bytes{mountpoint="/"})) * 100
```

**Application Metrics**:
```promql
# Request Rate
rate(app_requests_total[5m])

# Active Users
app_active_users

# Error Rate
rate(app_errors_total[5m])
```

#### Setup Grafana Dashboard
1. Login to Grafana (http://localhost:3000) with admin/devops123
2. Import popular dashboards:
   - **Node Exporter**: Dashboard ID 1860
   - **Docker Containers**: Dashboard ID 893
3. Create custom panels using the queries above

## 7. AI Prompt Journal

### Prompt 1: Foundation Understanding
**Prompt**: "I'm a junior DevOps engineer trying to learn new technologies in my area of specialization. So far, I've learned about source code management tools like Git, CI/CD tools like Jenkins pipelines, containerization tools like Docker and Kubernetes, IaC tools like Ansible, Vagrant, and Terraform, and Cloud Platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP. I've heard about monitoring tools like Prometheus and ELK, but other than that, I know very little about them. Now, I would like to learn, step by step, about Prometheus. I want you to be by companion and mentor along this journey. Specifically, I want you to help develop a comprehensive learning toolkit by creating a simple runnable project, document the steps clearly so others can replicate my process, and test and iterate my guide with peers."

**AI Response Summary**: AI explained Prometheus's pull-based architecture vs push-based systems, the role of exporters as metric collectors, time-series database concepts, and service discovery mechanisms. It clarified how Prometheus integrates with Kubernetes for dynamic service discovery and why it's preferred for cloud-native environments.

**My Evaluation**: This foundation was crucial for connecting Prometheus to my existing container knowledge. Understanding the "why" behind pull-based architecture made configuration choices much clearer and helped me see how Prometheus fits into the broader DevOps ecosystem.

### Prompt 2: Project Architecture Design
**Prompt**: "Design a hands-on Prometheus learning project using Docker Compose that demonstrates real-world DevOps monitoring scenarios. Include system monitoring, container monitoring, custom application metrics, visualization, and alerting. The project should be practical for someone with Docker/Kubernetes experience."

**AI Response Summary**: AI suggested a comprehensive stack with Node Exporter for system metrics, cAdvisor for container monitoring, Grafana for visualization, and a custom Flask app for application metrics. It explained the rationale for each component and how they work together to provide complete observability.

**My Evaluation**: Perfect project scoping that built on my containerization skills. The multi-component approach mirrors production monitoring setups, and including a custom application demonstrated how to instrument real applications for DevOps environments.

### Prompt 3: Configuration Deep Dive
**Prompt**: "Help me understand Prometheus configuration structure, specifically prometheus.yml format. Explain scrape_configs, job_name, targets, service discovery, and best practices for scraping intervals. Include examples for monitoring Docker containers and system metrics."

**AI Response Summary**: AI broke down the YAML configuration structure, explained the hierarchy of global settings, rules, and scrape configs. It provided practical guidance on scraping intervals and showed how to configure static vs dynamic service discovery.

**My Evaluation**: Critical for understanding Prometheus operations. The practical examples made abstract concepts concrete, and understanding scraping intervals was particularly valuable for production deployments and optimizing monitoring overhead.

### Prompt 4: PromQL Query Language
**Prompt**: "Teach me PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) with practical examples for common DevOps monitoring scenarios. Include queries for CPU usage, memory consumption, disk utilization, request rates, error rates, and how to create meaningful alerts using these metrics."

**AI Response Summary**: AI provided a structured PromQL tutorial starting with basic selectors, then functions like rate(), avg(), and sum(). It showed how to build complex queries for percentiles, ratios, and aggregations focused on infrastructure and application monitoring patterns.

**My Evaluation**: Extremely valuable for making Prometheus actionable. PromQL initially seemed intimidating, but the progressive examples made it approachable. Understanding functions like rate() was crucial for application monitoring and directly enables creating meaningful dashboards and alerts.

### Prompt 5: Custom Application Metrics
**Prompt**: "Show me how to instrument a Python Flask application with Prometheus metrics. Include different metric types (Counter, Gauge, Histogram) with practical examples for request counting, response times, active users, and system resource monitoring. Make it production-ready with proper error handling."

**AI Response Summary**: AI provided complete Python code using prometheus-client library, demonstrating Counter for requests, Gauge for active users, and Histogram for latencies. It included Flask middleware for automatic instrumentation and proper error handling.

**My Evaluation**: Essential for understanding application observability. The hands-on code examples were immediately applicable and production-ready. Learning when to use different metric types was crucial for proper instrumentation and directly applicable to monitoring microservices and APIs.

### Prompt 6: Production Troubleshooting
**Prompt**: "Help me troubleshoot common Prometheus deployment issues in Docker environments. Include networking problems between containers, permission errors, high memory usage, and service discovery failures. Provide debugging commands and solutions for each scenario."

**AI Response Summary**: AI provided systematic troubleshooting approaches including Docker networking diagnostics, permission fixes for data directories, memory optimization through retention policies, and connectivity testing between containers with specific commands and configuration adjustments.

**My Evaluation**: Invaluable for real-world deployments. The systematic debugging approach mirrors production troubleshooting methodologies. Understanding Docker networking implications for Prometheus was particularly important and will be essential when deploying monitoring in production environments.

## 8. Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Containers Fail to Start
**Problem**: Port conflicts with existing services
```
Error response from daemon: bind: address already in use
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check what's using the ports
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep -E ':(3000|5000|8080|9090|9100)'
# Stop conflicting services or change ports in docker-compose.yml
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

**Learning**: Always check port availability before deployment. In production, use proper port management and service discovery.

### Issue 2: Prometheus Targets Down
**Problem**: Targets showing as "DOWN" in Prometheus UI due to network connectivity issues

**Solution**:
```bash
# Test container connectivity
docker exec prometheus ping node-exporter
docker exec prometheus nslookup cadvisor
# Check container logs and verify metrics endpoints
docker-compose logs prometheus
curl http://localhost:9100/metrics
```

**Learning**: Docker networking uses container names as hostnames. Always test connectivity between containers when debugging service discovery.

### Issue 3: Permission Denied Errors
**Problem**: Incorrect file permissions for Docker volumes
```
level=error msg="opening storage failed" err="lock DB directory: permission denied"
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Development fix
sudo chmod 777 prometheus/data grafana/data
# Production solution
sudo chown -R 65534:65534 prometheus/data  # nobody user
sudo chown -R 472:472 grafana/data        # grafana user
```

**Learning**: Container processes run as specific users. Understanding user mapping between host and container is crucial for production deployments.

### Issue 4: High Memory Usage
**Problem**: Prometheus consuming excessive memory due to default retention settings

**Solution**: Add retention configuration in docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
prometheus:
  command:
    - '--storage.tsdb.retention.time=7d'
    - '--storage.tsdb.retention.size=1GB'
    - '--query.max-samples=50000000'
```

**Learning**: Prometheus memory usage scales with data retention. Production deployments need careful capacity planning and retention policies.

### Issue 5: Grafana Shows "No Data"
**Problem**: Incorrect data source configuration despite Prometheus collecting metrics

**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify Prometheus accessibility from Grafana container
docker exec grafana wget -qO- http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query?query=up
# Check data source configuration: URL should be http://prometheus:9090 (not localhost)
```

**Learning**: Container networking requires using service names, not localhost. Always verify connectivity when integrating services.

### Issue 6: cAdvisor Fails on macOS
**Problem**: cAdvisor container exits immediately on macOS due to missing cgroups filesystem

**Solution**: Use simplified cAdvisor configuration for macOS:
```yaml
cadvisor:
  image: gcr.io/cadvisor/cadvisor:v0.47.2
  volumes:
    - /:/rootfs:ro
    - /var/run:/var/run:ro
    - /sys:/sys:ro
    - /var/lib/docker:/var/lib/docker:ro
  # Remove cgroup and device mappings for macOS
```

**Learning**: Container monitoring tools have OS-specific requirements. Development environments may need different configurations than production Linux systems.
